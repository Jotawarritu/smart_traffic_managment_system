## 🌟 About the Project  

A Smart Traffic Management System uses advanced technologies such as IoT, AI, and sensors to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. 
It collects real-time data from cameras, sensors, and GPS devices to monitor traffic conditions. Using this data, it dynamically adjusts 
traffic signals, provides route suggestions, and prioritizes emergency vehicles. These systems aim to improve road safety, reduce travel
time, and minimize environmental impacts by lowering fuel consumption and emissions.

## 🛠 Modules in the Project  

1. *REAL TIME TRAFFIC MONITORING *  
   - Collect real-time traffic data using IoT sensors and cameras.
   
2. *TRAFFIC SIGNAL OPTIMISATION * 
   - Adjust signal timings dynamically based on vehicle density. 
  
3. *ALTERNATIVE ROUTE SUGGESTIONS *  
   -Provide drivers with less congested routes through a mobile app.
   
4. *EMERGENCY VEHICLE PRIORITY*  
   - Detect emergency vehicles and create a "green corridor" for their movement.
