## 🌟 About the Project  

The *City Management* project is a C++-based initiative aimed at solving urban management issues. This project focuses on four primary modules: *Residents Management, **Infrastructure Management, **Service Management, and **Transport Management*. Each module plays a crucial role in managing the complexities of a city's growth and development, utilizing algorithms for optimized management and resource allocation.

## 🛠 Modules in the Project  

1. *Residents Management*  
   - Tracks population data and manages citizen information.  
   - Handles registration, updates, and allocation of resources.  

2. *Infrastructure Management* (My Module!)  
   - Manages public infrastructure, such as roads, parks, and public buildings.  
   - Implements algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest path planning and facility maintenance.  

3. *Service Management*  
   - Monitors city services like water, electricity, and waste disposal.  
   - Uses dynamic scheduling and optimization techniques for service delivery.  

4. *Transport Management*  
   - Optimizes transportation routes and traffic flow within the city.  
   - Uses graph traversal (DFS/BFS) for route analysis and optimization.

## 🚀 Features  

- 📈 *Algorithmic Problem Solving: Implements C++ algorithms like Dijkstra's, A, and Kruskal's for efficient resource allocation and optimization.  
- 🌐 *Graph-Based Approach*: Efficient use of graph structures for transport and infrastructure management.  
- 🤝 *Collaborative Development*: Team-based development, with each member focusing on different modules.  
- 💡 *Scalable Design*: Modular architecture allowing easy expansion and future improvements.
